### Introduction
With advancement in medical and scientific technology, it is expected that the number of deaths has decrease. As there are numerous drugs and medical teachnologies avaliable to combat various diseases. Plus, our overall understanding of diseases has increases with utilisation of more accurate scientific research methods and tools.
### Question
1. Number of deaths has decrease overall from 1970 - 2010.
### Methods
- Datasets: Global burden of diseases, Population, GDP per Capita, Public health Expenditure, Number of diseases
- Cleaning the datasets: Used python to clean the datasets, remove any null values present and ensure the datasets were standardised.
- Visualisng the data: Used Seaborn, plotly and matplotlib to visualise and explore the data.
- Stats: Pearson coefficient, percentage change
### Results and Key Insights
- Number of deaths has increased overall from 1970 - 2010.
- Death rate per 100,000 had decreased overall from 1970 - 2010.
- There has been an increase in:
  - population rate
  - Number of diseases
  - GDP per capita
  - Public Health Expenditure
- There is a positive correlation between number of deaths and population.
- There is a positive correlation betweem number of deaths and number of diseases.
- There is a weak correlation between number of deaths and country GDP. The effects this correlation has varies based on continent.
- Overall there is no correlation between number of deaths and public health expenditure. However, further analysis show the relationship between these two factors in continent dependent. 
#### Potential reasons why number of deaths increased?
- Increase in population and increase in diseases resulted in communicable diseases to spread easily.
- An increased in GDP per capita does not always result in a deacrease in the number of death. The reason for this could be due to the unequal distribution of wealth.
- The impact of public health expenditure on the number of death might be country dependent. This is beacuse the access of public health facilities varies depending on the country.
### Recommedations:
- Ease access of public health services
- Increase public awareness of health facilities
- Educate the public about communicable diseases and the importance of a healthy lifestyle
- Increase funding of scientific reaserch and health care facilities
#### Further analysis:
- The deadliest diseases throughout the years, based on continets and the deadliest diseases from 1970 - 2010 analysis.
